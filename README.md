## What is Paint 'N Run?
paintNrun is a colorful new platformer that is taking the world by storm. Control a lovely square and protect it as it journeys thorough the vibrant blockey surroundings. Make sure to fill in the tiles that the square is standing on to avoid falling through the floor. Also be on the lookout for menacing rectangles that may be approaching from the horizon. 

How far can you get?

## How to Play:
- Use the arrow keys or W,A,S,D to control the white square on the screen.

- Tap W, the up arrow key, or spacebar to jump
- Fill in the tiles using the J,K,L,; keys OR by clicking on the associated colored squares below the game area
